# Quectel User Friendly SDK

## Key Features

1. This SDK compilation framework supports **`all models of the STM32 series`**
2. All relevant parameters and files for different MCU models are **`automatically adapted`**
3. Build files such as CMakeLists.txt and CMakePresets.json are **`automatically generated`**
4. The main functions of build.bat/build.sh include: **`configuration`**, **`compile`**, **`clean`**, **`download`**, and **`debug`**
5. The SDK comes with a built-in cross-compilation toolchain, requiring **`no manual setup`** of the compilation environment
6. Equipped with automated scripts to perform all the above operations with one click, **`ready-to-use without manual configuration`**

## Build Environment

    This SDK includes a cross-compilation toolchain in the tools directory.


## Compilation Commands:
    Execute the following commands in the SDK root directory:

    build.bat config      # Configure the system
    build.bat all         # Compile
    build.bat clean       # Clean up
    build.bat download    # Download
    build.bat debug       # Debug

## Notes:
    The build.bat config command can be followed by two parameters: [chip model][version number], for example:
    build.bat config STM32F413RGT6 your_firmware_version

    If the [chip model][version number] parameters are omitted, the previously configured chip model and version number will be used.
    If there is no prior configuration record upon first use, the chip will default to STM32F413RGT6, and the version number will default to the format Quectel_UFP_Chip_Date, for example, Quectel_UFP_STM32F413RGT6_20250430
